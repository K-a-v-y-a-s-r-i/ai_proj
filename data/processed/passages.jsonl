Stigma is especially problematic for people living with these conditions because it can create barriers to accessing necessary social and structural supports, which can intensify their experiences with stigma. This review aims to contribute to the knowledge on stigma by advancing a cross-analysis of HIV/AIDS, mental illness, and physical disability stigma, and exploring whether and how intersectionality frameworks have been used in the systematic reviews of stigma."}

Combining drought resistance with yield and desirable economic traits is the most promising solution for the researchers. Although several studies resulted in the identification of QTLs for drought resistance in rice, but none of them serve as a milestone."}
{"source": "31086495.xml", "text": "Therefore, there is always a quest to find the new QTLs. The present investigation was carried out to map QTLs involved in drought resistance and yield related parameter in a cross of IR55419-04 and Super Basmati. An F2 population of 418 individuals was used as the mapping population."}

Two hundred thirty microsatellite markers staggered on the whole genome were used for identifying polymorphic markers between the two parents. The selected 73 polymorphic microsatellites were used to genotype individuals and were scattered on a distance of 1735 cM on all 12 linkage groups."}

The QTLs relating to drought tolerance at the vegetative stage were found on chromosome 1. Novel genomic regions were detected in the marker interval RM520-RM143 and RM168-RM520."}

MVD has been successfully applied to hundreds of different proteins, with docking performance similar to other docking programs such as AutoDock4 and AutoDock Vina. The program MVD has four search algorithms and four native scoring functions."}
{"source": "31452104.xml", "text": "Considering that we may have water molecules or not in the docking simulations, we have a total of 32 docking protocols. The integration of the programs SAnDReS ( https://github.com/azevedolab/sandres ) and MVD opens the possibility to carry out a detailed statistical analysis of docking results, which adds to the native capabilities of the program MVD. In this chapter, we describe a tutorial to carry out docking simulations with MVD and how to perform a statistical analysis of the docking results with the program SAnDReS."}
